You _could_ tell your guests to take pictures and post them to their social media accounts using an event hashtag but we have a [whole post on why that's not such a great idea](https://blog.eventphonenumber.com/blog/5-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-count-on-a-hashtag/).

<br />

You could also tell your guests to text _you_ their photos but handing your phone number out to everyone isn't very appealing either...

<br />

Instead, you can get a unique phone number specifically for your event that your guests can text their photos into. It's surprisingly easy too.

<br />

Let me tell you about a company called [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/messaging). Twilio is a publicly traded company that offers programmable phone numbers(among other things). You can purchase a phone number from Twilio for $1.00/month with no long term contract.

Once you have a phone number, you can send text messages to it and those messages are stored in your phone number's Twilio dashboard. Picture messages only [cost one cent each to receive](https://www.twilio.com/sms/pricing/us).

</span>

Even though these are "programmable" phone numbers, you don't have to know any programming at all. Once you've purchased a phone number, you're all set to start telling your guests to text their pictures in immediately. Here's some ideas on how to do that:

<br />

<ul class="list-disc">

<li>Set up a chalkboard at the venue entrance that says something similar to "Sign our guestbook by texting a selfie to (xxx) xxx-xxxx!"</li>

<li>Use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Table-Place-Cards-Place-Card-Holders/b?ie=UTF8&node=13468941" target="_blank"> place cards on the tables</a> to tell your guests to share their photos by texting them into your phone number</li>

<li>Ask your DJ to announce at some point, "The bride and groom want to remember as much as possible about this day. Help them do that by taking a picture of your group and texting it to (xxx) xxx-xxxx!"</li>

</ul>

<br />

You'll instantly have several of your guest's unique photos stored in your Twilio account for you to view and download afterwards. In the **Incoming** messages table, click each message's **Date** to view the pictures attached to the message. Right click the picture and select **Save Image as...**

</span>

Once your event is over and you've downloaded your photos, simply "Release" the phone number to stop paying the $1/month.

</span>

**Make sure you've downloaded your photos though!** You will not have access to them after the phone number has been released.

<br />

That's it! You now have a digital guestbook of sorts! 

<br />

I hope this has been informative and given you another option to consider in your event planning.

If you love the idea but are looking for a little more bells and whistles, we've got you covered. [EventPhoneNumber.com](https://eventphonenumber.com) takes advantage of the "programmable" aspect of Twilio's phone numbers. When you get a phone number through us you get:

<br />

<ul class="list-disc">

<li>A live, sharable gallery</li>

<li>A live slideshow to display at the venue</li>

<li>The ability to keep and download all of your pictures at once forever(even after the phone number has been released)</li>

<li>A customizable auto-response when a guest texts in a photo for the first time that contains a link to the gallery</li>

<li>The ability to screen which photos make it to your gallery and slideshow. We'll even do that for you to ensure no questionable pictures from your guests get displayed during your event</li>

</ul>
