You _could_ tell your guests to take pictures and post them to their social media accounts using an event hashtag but we have a [whole post on why that's not such a great idea](https://blog.eventphonenumber.com/blog/5-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-count-on-a-hashtag/).

<br />

You could also tell your guests to text _you_ their photos but handing your phone number out to everyone isn't very appealing either...

<br />

Instead, you can get a unique phone number specifically for your event that your guests can text their photos into. It's surprisingly easy too.

<br />

Let me tell you about a company called [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/messaging). Twilio is a publicly traded company that offers programmable phone numbers(among other things). You can purchase a phone number from Twilio for $1.00/month with no long term contract. Yes, you read that right...$1 dollar per month.

Once you have a phone number, you can send text messages to it and those messages are stored in your phone number's Twilio dashboard. Picture messages only [cost one cent each to receive](https://www.twilio.com/sms/pricing/us).

Even though these are "programmable" phone numbers, you don't have to know any programming at all. Once you've purchased a phone number, you're all set to start telling your guests to text their pictures in immediately. Here's some ideas on how to do that:

<br />

<span class="list-disc">

* Set up a chalkboard at the venue entrance that says something similar to "Sign our guestbook by texting a selfie to (xxx) xxx-xxxx!"
* Use [place cards on the tables](https://www.amazon.com/Table-Place-Cards-Place-Card-Holders/b?ie=UTF8&node=13468941) to tell your guests to share their photos by texting them into your phone number
* Ask your DJ to announce at some point, "The bride and groom want to remember as much as possible about this day. Help them do that by taking a picture of your group and texting it to (xxx) xxx-xxxx!"

</span>

<br />

You'll instantly have several of your guest's unique photos stored in your Twilio account for you to view and download afterwards. In the **Incoming** messages table, click each message's **Date** to view the pictures attached to the message. Right click the picture and select **Save Image as...**

</span>

Once your event is over and you've downloaded your photos, simply "Release" the phone number to stop paying the $1/month.

**Make sure you've downloaded your photos though!** You will not have access to them after the phone number has been released.
