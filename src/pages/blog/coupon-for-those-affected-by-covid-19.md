COVID-19 has rocked all of our worlds, disrupting all sorts of our plans. If you've had to reschedule your wedding or other major celebration we'd like to offer you 75% off of our standard 48 hour event phone number service to ease _some_ of your pain. Re-planning big events is a total bummer and we realize some vendors may not be able to provide service due to prior commitments. If this is your situation, we'd like to offer our support. 

Enter coupon code **BEATC19** to save 75% off of our standard service. For only $24.99, you'll receive a custom phone number for your guests to text in the photos they take at your event to contribute to a live online gallery.

Also, know that this virus isn't a bad omen for your celebration. Something like this can easily put you in a bad headspace. Don't let it. This will pass and the celebrations will happen!

Stay safe out there!
