## 1.

Not everyone participates in social media. Weddings are guaranteed to have attendees that aren't into having a social media presence. These guests will automatically be excluded from sharing their experience if a hashtag is their only means to do so.

## 2.

Which site will your guests post to? Facebook? Twitter? Instagram? Snapchat? Your guests will post on their favorite platform. You might not even have an account on their platform of choice. Tracking down posts on an ever-growing list of sites is a headache. Downloading them all is an even bigger chore. Oh and don't forget to back them up just in case.

## 3.

Most likely you won't be friends with all of your guests on social media. Even if some of your guests and their +1's use your hashtag, it'll depend on their privacy settings and platform if you even have a chance to see their posts. 

## 4.

Social media algorithms make it harder and harder to find posts as time passes. These sites are designed to show the newest, most popular content. Unfortunately that means it makes it harder and harder to find older posts. 

## 5.

Coming up with the perfect hashtag is stressful. It needs to be unique, fun, and memorable but not too complicated to where your guests could type it wrong. Wedding planning is stressful enough. There's no need to put unnecessary pressure on yourself for little benefit when it's all said and done.

## The Fix

Use that cute hashtag you came up with in a new gmail address and have your guests send them there. If you think that could be too cumbersome, consider encouraging them to text them to your personal phone number. Having a single place for you guests to send their photos will guarantee you see the most.
<br /><br />
If you're not too keen on exposing your personal phone number to all of your guests, consider using <a href="https://eventphonenumber.com">EventPhoneNumber.com</a>. When you create an account you'll be assigned a brand new unique phone number to encourage your guests to text their photos to. The photos will be aggregated into a beautiful live gallery where everyone can enjoy them instantly. The photos will stay in your account forever where you can download them all at any time.
<br /><br />
Wedding hashtags are meant for you to be able to track down your photos afterwards. Unfortunately, they do a pretty bad job at that. If you want to capture the most memories from your big day, ditch the hashtag.
